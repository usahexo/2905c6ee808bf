#  IGT Expands Slot Portfolio to Morocco

IGT, the global gaming giant, has announced the expansion of its slot portfolio to include the newly built Casino du Louvre in Casablanca, Morocco. The new casino is operated by Société des Bains de Mer (SBM) and will feature IGT’s market-leading games and systems, including the award-winning Cleopatra game and CrystalDual cabinet.

“Casino du Louvre is an impressive facility with a top-class design that offers a unique gaming experience for players in Morocco”, said John Connelly, IGT President of North America. “The deployment of our best-in-class games and systems will contribute to the success of Casino du Louvre and help solidify our leading position in this important market.”

Morocco is a key market for IGT with a population of over 33 million and a rapidly growing gaming industry. In addition to Casino du Louvre, IGT operates six other land-based casinos in Morocco, as well as a number of online gaming sites.

#  Gaming Manufacturer IGT Adds Morocco to Slot Portfolio

International Game Technology (IGT) announced the launch of its first game in Morocco, marking the gaming manufacturer’s entry into Africa’s second-largest economy. The new game, called Gold Dragon, is a five-reel slot available in both English and Arabic.

IGT has seen success with its games in other African markets and is confident that Gold Dragon will be well received in Morocco. The company plans to further develop its presence in the country with additional products and services tailored to local players.

Morocco has a population of over 35 million people and a rapidly growing gaming market. In 2016, total casino revenue reached MAD 2.3 billion (USD 260 million), up from MAD 2 billion (USD 223 million) in 2015. This growth is expected to continue, with industry analysts predicting that casino revenue will reach MAD 3.5 billion (USD 392 million) by 2020.

With this expanding market potential, it’s no wonder that IGT is keen to expand into Morocco. The company already has a strong footprint in Africa, with games deployed in countries such as South Africa, Nigeria, and Kenya. IGT’s entry into Morocco marks an important step in its goal of becoming a global player in the gaming industry.
