#  Are you ready for skillet casino's W2 cash out? 

If you're a former or current employee at one of the many W2-based casinos in Nevada, you're no doubt anxiously awaiting news of when your employer will initiate the much anticipated cash out. According to industry insiders, the payout could come as early as this week, though there is always the possibility of a delay. So what should you do in order to be ready when the time comes?

# 1 Get your paperwork in order 

Assuming you want to receive your payout in cash, you'll need to have all of your identification and other required documents ready. This includes your social security card, driver's license or state identification card, and proof of residence. If you have any other questions about what is required, be sure to contact your employer directly.

# 2 Review your bank account information 

In order to receive your payout, you'll need to have a bank account with a U.S. financial institution that participates in the ACH Network. You'll also need routing and account numbers for that account. Again, if you have any questions about this process, be sure to talk to your employer.

# 3 Have funds available in that bank account 

When the time comes for your employer to initiate the cash out, they will deposit the funds into your bank account electronically. This means that you'll need to have enough money in that account to cover the amount being deposited. If you don't have enough money available, the transfer will be cancelled and you'll need to reach out to your employer for further instructions.
