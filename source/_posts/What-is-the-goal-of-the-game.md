#  What is the goal of the game?

The goal of the game is to score as many points as possible by batting a small white ball around a large outdoor playing field.

# What do I need to bring?

Bring your friends, sunscreen, water, and a good attitude! We provide the bats, balls, and bases.

# Can I bring my dog?

We love dogs, but unfortunately they are not allowed on the premises.

# How much does it cost?

Admission is free for all ages! However, we do suggest a $5 donation per person to help support our park and its programs.

#  What are the controls?

The controls of a car are the mechanisms and devices that are used to steer, brake, and accelerate it. They vary depending on the make and model of the vehicle, but typically include a steering wheel, pedals for accelerating and braking, and a gear shift.

# How do I use them?

The way in which you use the controls depends on the vehicle. Generally, the accelerator pedal is pushed down to speed up the car, and released to slow down. The brake pedal is applied with pressure to slow or stop the car. The steering wheel is turned left or right to change direction. The gear shift is used to select different gears that control how fast the car travels. For more information on how to use the specific controls of your car, consult your owner's manual.

#  What are the power-ups in the game?

There are a few power-ups in the game that can help you take on the enemy and come out victorious. One of these is the power-up that turns your tank into a wrecking ball, allowing you to smash through everything in your way. There is also a power-up that increases your speed, letting you run circles around the enemy tanks. Finally, there is a power-up that shoots faster and further, letting you take out tanks from a distance. Make sure to use these power-ups wisely to dominate the battlefield!

#  What are the enemies in the game?

There are many different types of enemies in the game. Some of the most common enemies include:

* Zombies
 * Skeletons
 * Spiders
 * Creepers

Each type of enemy has its own unique abilities and strengths. For example, zombies are especially dangerous because they can infect other players with a deadly virus. Creepers are also particularly dangerous because they explode when they get close to players, causing massive damage.

Knowing how to deal with different types of enemies is essential for success in the game. To survive, players need to be able to identify the enemies and know how to defeat them.

#  How do I beat the final boss?

First, you need to understand how the boss works.

The boss has three different attack phases:

* The first phase is a simple melee attack.

* The second phase involves shooting projectiles.

* The third phase is a more powerful melee attack.

To defeat the boss, you need to exploit its weaknesses during these phases.

For the first phase, you can simply stay away from it and shoot it with your rifle.

For the second phase, you can hide behind the pillars to avoid getting hit by the projectiles.

For the third phase, you can use your rocket launcher to stun him and then quickly run up to him and finish him off with your knife.
