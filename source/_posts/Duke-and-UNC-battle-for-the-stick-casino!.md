They are also very good rebounders, averaging over 43 boards per game. However, they can be susceptible to turnovers as well, averaging nearly 16 per game.

#  Will Duke's Coach K add another win to his already impressive record?

The Duke Blue Devils are one of the top college basketball teams in the country. Led by head coach Mike Krzyzewski, they have had a lot of success in the past. This year looks to be no different, as they are currently ranked second in the nation.

Coach K is one of the most successful coaches in college basketball history. He has led the Blue Devils to five national championships and has an impressive record of 1,071 wins and just 291 losses. With Coach K at the helm, Duke is always a threat to win it all.

However, this year's team is not without its challenges. The Blue Devils have had a few close calls already this season, including a last-minute loss to North Carolina State and a triple-overtime victory over Virginia. They will need to play better if they want to make a run at the national championship.

One thing is for sure: Coach K knows how to win. He has turned Duke into one of the premier programs in college basketball, and there is no sign that he intends to slow down anytime soon.

#  Can UNC-CH keep up with one of the best teams in the NCAA?

The North Carolina Tar Heels basketball team is set to square off against the Gonzaga Bulldogs on Saturday in the Final Four. The Tar Heels are a storied program, but they’ll be up against a very good Gonzaga team.

Gonzaga is one of the best teams in the country and they have proved it by making it to the Final Four. The Bulldogs have an offense that can score with anyone, and they also play tough defense. They should give UNC a tough test on Saturday.

The Tar Heels will need to play their best basketball to beat Gonzaga. They have the advantage of playing at home, but they’ll need to take care of the ball and hit their shots if they want to win.

Frank Martin has done an excellent job coaching this team, and he will need to come up with a game plan to beat Gonzaga. If UNC can execute properly, they have a chance to win this game and make it to the National Championship.

#  Get your bets in now - this is sure to be a close game!

The Super Bowl is just around the corner, and whether you're rooting for the Patriots or the Falcons, one thing is for sure - it's going to be an exciting game. If you're looking to place a bet on the big showdown, now is the time to do it!

There are a number of different ways to bet on the Super Bowl, but most people will place either a moneyline bet or a point spread bet. With a moneyline bet, you simply pick who you think will win the game. The odds are based on which team is favored - the Patriots are typically favored over the Falcons, so if you want to bet on New England, your payout would be smaller than if you were to bet on Atlanta.

With a point spread bet, you're betting on who will cover the given point spread. This can be a little more complicated, as it takes into account both teams' strengths and weaknesses. Typically, the favorite will be given a points advantage in order to make the game more competitive. So if you think that the Patriots will win by more than 3 points, you would place a wager on them - if they only win by 2 points or less, you would lose your bet.

No matter which type of bet you choose, now is definitely the time to get in on the action. With such close odds, any small difference could mean a big payout! Make sure to do your research and choose wisely - may the best team win!
