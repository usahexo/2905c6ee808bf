#  Los Angeles Dodgers to Win NL West, Vegas Odds at -125

The Los Angeles Dodgers are poised to win the NL West this season, with Vegas odds at -125 to take the division. The Dodgers have made some major acquisitions in the offseason, including veteran pitcher Alex Wood and first baseman Adrian Gonzalez.

The Dodgers will be led by their star pitcher Clayton Kershaw, who is coming off of a fourth-place finish in NL Cy Young voting. Kershaw, who is entering his eighth season in the majors, is one of the best pitchers in baseball and will be a major asset for the Dodgers this season.

The Dodgers also have some other young stars on their roster, including shortstop Corey Seager and outfielder Joc Pederson. Seager, 21, was voted as the best defensive shortstop in MLB by Baseball America and Pederson, 23, finished second in National League Rookie of the Year voting last season.

With a young roster and some of the best players in baseball, the Dodgers are primed to make a deep playoff run this season.

#  San Francisco Giants Opening at +275 to Win NL West

The San Francisco Giants were one of the most active teams during the offseason, making big moves to improve their roster. They added star outfielder Andrew McCutchen and third baseman Evan Longoria, which makes them the favorites to win the NL West.

The Los Angeles Dodgers are still the favorites to win the division, but the Giants are a close second. The Dodgers have been dominant in recent years, winning the NL West five times in a row, but this year there is a new challenger in town.

The Giants opened at +275 to win the NL West and that looks like a great value right now. They have a very talented roster and should be able to compete with the Dodgers for the division title. Look for them to make a run at the World Series this year and they could be one of the dark horses in the playoffs.

#  Arizona Diamondbacks 8/1 Odds to Win 2017 National League West

The Arizona Diamondbacks begin their quest to defend their National League West title on Monday when they open the season at home against the Colorado Rockies. Arizona is listed at 8/1 odds to win the NL West according to Bovada, putting them second behind the Los Angeles Dodgers, who are at 2/9.

The Diamondbacks were a surprise contender last year, winning 89 games and claiming the NL Wild Card spot. They then beat the Dodgers in the Division Series before losing to the Cubs in the NLCS. This year's team is largely unchanged, with Zack Greinke and Robbie Ray leading a strong rotation and Paul Goldschmidt anchoring an offense that also includes A.J. Pollock, David Peralta, and Jake Lamb.

The Dodgers are still the favorites to win the division, but the Diamondbacks should be right there in the mix. They have a good chance to return to the playoffs and could even make a run at another World Series berth.

#  Colorado Rockies 20/1 Longshots to Win NL West in 2017

The Colorado Rockies were one of the surprise teams in baseball last season, as they finished the year with a record of 87-75. Unfortunately for them, they still missed out on the playoffs by one game.

This season, however, many are expecting them to take a step back. The Rockies are currently listed at 20/1 to win the NL West, which is behind six other teams.

There are a few reasons why the Rockies may not be as good this season. For starters, they lost some key players in the offseason, including Carlos Gonzalez and Trevor Story. They also had a very inconsistent offense last season, which is something that they will need to improve on if they want to make the playoffs.

On the other hand, the Rockies do have some talent on their roster. Their pitching staff is led by Jon Gray and Tyler Anderson, and they also have some young hitters who could breakout this season, including Nolan Arenado and Charlie Blackmon.

Overall, itâ€™s tough to know what to expect from the Rockies this season. They certainly have some upside and could easily compete for a playoff spot. However, there are also some risks involved here, so it might be best to avoid betting on them until we have a better idea of how they will perform.

#  Los Angeles Dodgers Favored by Las Vegas to Win Fifth Straight NL West Title

The <a href="https://www.lasvegas.com/sports/mlb/los-angeles-dodgers/" target="_blank">Los Angeles Dodgers</a> are the favorites to win their fifth consecutive National League West division title, according to OddsShark.

<p> The Dodgers are currently listed as 2-1 favorites to win the NL West, followed by the Colorado Rockies at 7-2 and the Arizona Diamondbacks at 5-1. The San Francisco Giants are next at 16-1, followed by the San Diego Padres at 100-1.</p>

<p> This will be a tight race, as all of these teams look poised to compete for a playoff spot. The Dodgers have been one of the best teams in baseball this season, thanks in part to their dominant starting rotation. Led by Clayton Kershaw and Walker Buehler, Los Angeles' starters have a combined 2.84 ERA this season.</p>

<p> The Rockies have also been playing well lately, thanks in part to their young stars Nolan Arenado and Trevor Story. Colorado is currently 8-3 in their last 11 games and has surged into second place in the NL West. </p>

<p> The Diamondbacks have been up and down this season, but they still have some talented players on their roster. Paul Goldschmidt is one of the best hitters in baseball, and Zack Greinke is still one of the top pitchers in the league.</p>

<p> The Giants have struggled this season, but they always seem to find a way to compete late in the year. They will be led by veterans like Buster Posey and Madison Bumgarner.</p>

<p> The Padres are rebuilding and aren't expected to compete for a playoff spot this season. However, they do have some young talent on their roster, including Fernando Tatis Jr. and Manny Machado.</p>
