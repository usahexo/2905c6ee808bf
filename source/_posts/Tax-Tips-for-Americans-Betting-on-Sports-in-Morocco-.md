#  Tax Tips for Americans Betting on Sports in Morocco 

As the NFL season kicks off, many American expats are looking to place bets on their favorite teams. If you're one of them, be sure to keep these tax tips in mind:

1. Gambling income is taxable in Morocco.

2. You must report any gambling winnings on your annual tax return.

3. You can claim gambling losses as a deduction on your return, but only up to the amount of gambling income you report.

4. Be sure to keep accurate records of your bets and winnings/losses. This will help with completing your tax return accurately.

#  How to File Taxes for Your Overseas Betting Winnings 

If you won money from betting on events outside of the United States, you will likely need to file an IRS Form 1040NR (Nonresident Alien Income Tax Return) to declare your winnings. Depending on the amount of your winnings and the tax laws of your home country, you may also have to file other forms with the IRS and your home country’s tax authority.

The first step is to calculate the “gross income” from your betting winnings. This is the total amount of money you won, minus any losses or deductions you may have. On Form 1040NR, this line is labeled “Line 21: Gambling Income.”

In order to declare your gambling income, you will need to know the following:
- The amount of your winnings 
- The type of bet or wager 
- The date(s) of the event(s) 
- The country where the event took place 

If you can provide this information, the IRS has a handy worksheet that can help you calculate your gambling income. You can find it on Publication 525, Miscellaneous Deductions. 

Assuming that you are a nonresident alien for tax purposes, here are some things to keep in mind when filing your Form 1040NR: 
- Gambling income is generally subject to a 30% withholding tax, which is taken out by the payer. This means that if you win $1,000, $300 will be withheld and sent to the IRS. 
- If you itemize deductions on your return, you may be able to claim a deduction for gambling losses. However, these losses cannot exceed your gambling income. 
- Winnings from horse racing, dog racing, jai alai, and lotteries are all considered taxable (even if they were won in another country). Winnings from casino games are not taxable unless they are considered “at-risk” (i.e., you could potentially lose more than you wagered). 
- You must report all gambling winnings even if they were not taxed in the country where they were earned. For example, if you live in Canada but won a bet on an American racehorse, you must still report the winnings on your US tax return.

#  IRS Warns of Risky Tax Schemes Involving Offshore Gambling

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has cautioned taxpayers that schemes involving offshore gambling can result in significant financial losses.

In a recent alert, the IRS warned taxpayers about a number of schemes that promise big tax breaks by using offshore gambling services. The schemes advertised, typically online, offer to help taxpayers conceal their income and incorrectly claim it as gambling losses.

One such scheme promises to help investors avoid paying taxes on their winnings by setting up an offshore account with a gambling site. The taxpayer is then told to make all of their bets through this account, so the winnings can be claimed as losses. However, this approach can be risky, as it’s easy for the IRS to track down unreported income and assess steep penalties and fines.

Other schemes involve using foreign bank accounts to hide income from gambling sites. In these cases, taxpayers are told they don’t need to report the income on their tax returns if it’s deposited into a foreign bank account. However, the IRS notes that these accounts must still be reported on Form TD F 90-22.1 (Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts).

Taxpayers who participate in any of these schemes risk significant fines and penalties from the IRS. In addition, any money earned from illegal activities is subject to seizure by the agency. So if you’re thinking about using an offshore gambling service to reduce your tax bill, it’s important to think again – the risks may not be worth it.
