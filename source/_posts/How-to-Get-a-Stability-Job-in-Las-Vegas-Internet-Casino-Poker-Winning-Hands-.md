#  How to stay safe and successful while playing poker in a Las Vegas internet casino

Las Vegas is one of the top destinations in the world for gambling. The city offers visitors a wide range of casinos, from small joints with a few tables to massive resorts with thousands of machines and games. But if you're not from Las Vegas, or if you've never been to a casino before, it can be difficult to know how to behave. And since playing poker in an internet casino is very different from playing at a live table, it's important to understand the dos and don'ts of online poker before sitting down at a virtual table.

Here are six tips for staying safe and successful while playing poker in a Las Vegas internet casino:

1) Don't Gamble More Than You Can Afford To Lose

Gambling is fun, but it should always be considered a form of entertainment. Never gamble more than you can afford to lose. If you start getting too attached to the idea of winning money, or if you become convinced that Lady Luck is on your side, you're going to start making bad decisions that can cost you dearly. Play within your budget, and remember that there will always be another game.

2) Don't Drink Or Take Drugs While Playing Poker

This one should be obvious, but it's worth repeating nonetheless. Alcohol and drugs impair your judgment and make it harder to make rational decisions. If you're drunk or high when you sit down at a poker table, you're likely to make bad choices that will hurt your bankroll. So play sober and stay sharp while playing online poker in Las Vegas.

3) Don't Chase Your Losses

One of the biggest mistakes gamblers make is chasing their losses. When you're losing money, it's natural to want to try and win it back as quickly as possible. But this almost always leads to even bigger losses in the long run. Instead of trying to recoup your losses all at once, take a break from the game and come back when you're feeling more level-headed. This will help prevent you from making costly mistakes in an attempt to win back your lost money.
