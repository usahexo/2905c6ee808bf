#  Who are the Minnesota Twins?

The Minnesota Twins are a professional baseball team based in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The Twins compete in the American League (AL) Central division of Major League Baseball (MLB).

The team is named after the Twin Cities area comprising Minneapolis and St. Paul. They were founded in 1961 as the Washington Senators, one of two expansion teams added to the American League that year. The Senators moved to Minnesota in 1961, and played their first season as the Twins at Metropolitan Stadium in Bloomington, before moving to the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome in 1982. After 28 years in the dome, the Twins moved to Target Field in downtown Minneapolis in 2010.

The Twins have won three World Series titles (1924, 1987, and 1991), and have played in four (1961, 1965, 1987, and 1991).

#  What is Frisch?

Frisch is a small, fast, and memory-efficient functional programming language developed by Hannes Mehnert. It has an intuitive syntax and efficient runtime, making it well-suited for data analysis, scientific computing, web development, and more.

# The Basics

In Frisch, every function takes one or more arguments. There are three types of functions in Frisch:

Primitive functions — these are the basic building blocks of the language and cannot be divided into further categories. Functions that take one argument are called unary functions, while those that take two arguments are called binary functions.

Container functions — these are functions that operate on collections of data. They can be divided into two categories: mapping functions and folding functions. Mapping functions apply a function to each element in a collection, while folding functions reduce a collection to a single value by combining its elements using a function.

Special operators — these are operators that have special meaning in Frisch and cannot be defined using the other two categories. There are three special operators in Frisch: cons , : , and list . cons constructs a new list by appending an element to an existing list, : is used to create tuples (two-element lists), and list converts a value to a list.

#  Why was the casino house built?

Casinos have been around for centuries, with the first one reportedly opening in Venice, Italy in 1638. But why were they built in the first place?

There are a few different theories on why casinos were created. One is that they were originally built as a way to control gambling and prevent people from losing too much money. Another theory is that they were built as a way to generate revenue for the government.

Whatever the reason, casinos have become an iconic part of many cultures around the world. They are a popular tourist destination and can be a lot of fun to visit. Whether you’re there to gamble or just to enjoy the atmosphere, casinos are definitely worth checking out!

#  How did the Twins end up in Frisch?

The Minneapolis Tribune headline of October 8, 1920, blared “FRISCH CONQUERS TWINS.” The St. Paul Pioneer Press proclaimed the next day, “Frisch Wins Title as Twin Cities Champions.” How could two papers covering the same game have such different headlines?

The answer is that one paper was referring to the baseball team from St. Paul, which had won the championship, and the other paper was referring to the baseball team from Minneapolis, which had lost.

The two teams were actually called the Twins because they were both owned by a man named Bill Frisch. He bought the St. Paul team in 1915 and moved it to Minneapolis in 1916. The Minneapolis team had been playing in Nicollet Park, but when Frisch moved them to Nicollet Park he renamed it Emerson Park.

In 1920, the two teams finally ended up in a showdown for the championship. The St. Paul team was known as the Saints, while the Minneapolis team was known as the Millers. The Saints won 6-5 in a game played at Lexington Park in Saint Paul.
