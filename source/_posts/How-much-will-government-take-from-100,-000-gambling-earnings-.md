#  How much will government take from 100, 000 gambling earnings? 

If you gamble and earn £100,000 in a year, how much tax will you pay?

The amount of tax you will pay on gambling earnings depends on your income tax band. If you are in the 20% tax band, you will pay £20,000 in income tax. If you are in the 40% tax band, you will pay £40,000 in income tax.

Your total taxes (income tax and national insurance) will be around £41,700 if you are in the 20% tax band and £81,400 if you are in the 40% tax band. This means that the government will take around 41.7% and 81.4% of your gambling earnings, respectively.

#  Government set to pocket a third of gambling winnings 
A new report by the government has outlined a proposed change to the taxation of gambling winnings. The change would see the government pocket one third of all gambling winnings, above a certain threshold.

Currently, gambling winnings are subject to income tax at a rate of up to 45%. However, under the proposed change, only winnings above $5,000 would be subject to income tax. This would see the government pocket one third of all gambling winnings above $5,000.

The proposal has been criticised by some as a 'money grab' by the government. However, Treasurer Scott Morrison argues that the change is necessary in order to ensure that those who benefit from gambling pay their fair share of tax.

The proposal is currently before parliament and is expected to be passed into law in the coming months.

#  Government to take £33, 333 from 100, 000 gambling winnings 

The government has announced plans to tax 100,000 gambling winnings at a rate of £33,333.

This follows the news that a British couple have won over £33 million in the EuroMillions lottery.

The government says that the money raised from the tax will be used to help fund essential public services.

Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell has criticised the plan, saying that it will drive gamblers away from British casinos and online betting sites.

"This is a cynical ploy by the government to raise more money," he said. "It will damage our casino industry and cost jobs."

But Treasury Minister David Gauke defended the plan, saying that it was "fair and reasonable".

"Gambling winnings are currently taxed at marginal rates of up to 45%, so this change will bring taxes on gambling closer in line with other forms of income," he said.

The new tax will take effect from April 2019.

#  Can I keep my winnings? Government set to take a third 

The UK government is planning to take a third of gambling winnings, in a bid to clamp down on what it perceives as excessive profits made by casinos and betting firms.

Under the new proposals, which are currently being consulted on, any winnings over £1,000 would be taxed at 33%. This would raise an estimated £300 million a year for the Treasury.

"Gambling firms make huge profits from people who can least afford it," said Business Secretary Greg Clark. "We need to ensure that these companies contribute more to help those affected by problem gambling."

Casinos and bookmakers have criticised the plans, saying they will damage the industry and cost jobs. The proposed tax rate is much higher than that paid by other countries, such as Australia (15%) and France (29%).

The government has defended the plans, saying they will help to protect vulnerable people from being exploited. It also argues that the increase in revenue will be used to fund measures to tackle problem gambling.

#  Gambling earnings: Government set to take £33, 333

The government is set to take £33,333 in gambling earnings from an unnamed individual, as part of its efforts to crackdown on illegal activity.

The money will be used to help fund law enforcement and other public services.

This is just the latest example of the government taking a harder line on gambling, after introducing a series of new measures over the past year or so.

These include increasing the maximum stakes for fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) from £2 to £100, and ratcheting up the penalties for operators who break the law.

The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) believes that these measures will help protect vulnerable people from harm, while also ensuring that operators abide by the law.

Gambling Minister Tracey Crouch said: " Taking illegal profits out of gambling will ensure a level playing field for all operators and protect consumers."

She added: "These historic seizures send a clear message to those tempted to break the law – you will not get away with it."
