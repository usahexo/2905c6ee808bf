#  Daniel Craig Goes All In with Poker Scene in Casino Royale

Daniel Craig’s poker scene in Casino Royale is one for the ages. He was completely in his element and it showed in his performance. It’s a powerful, mesmerizing scene that is as exciting as it is tense.

The scene begins with Bond sitting at a high stakes poker game in Montenegro. He’s playing against some of the best players in the world, and he quickly proves to be a formidable opponent. He starts winning hand after hand, and the other players quickly become suspicious. They start to wonder if Bond is cheating, but he quickly silences their doubts with a few well-played hands.

Things start to get really interesting when Bond goes all in on a hand worth over $200,000. His opponents are sure that he’s bluffing, but they decide to call anyway. To everyone’s amazement, Bond reveals his cards and wins the hand. This sends the other players into complete chaos, and they quickly begin to scatter from the table.

#  How Poker Scenes are Shaping Up in Casino Royale

The poker scenes in the 2006 movie Casino Royale were rightly lauded for their realism. In order to achieve that, the filmmakers hired Greg Mottola, a professional poker player with more than two decades of experience, as a technical advisor.

Mottola was responsible for ensuring that the poker scenes in the movie looked and felt realistic. That’s no small feat, as most people have a limited understanding of how poker is played.

Fortunately, Mottola was able to inject some of his expertise into the proceedings, resulting in some truly memorable scenes. In particular, the hand involving Vesper Lynd and Le Chiffre is one of the most iconic moments in the entire movie.

With that said, there were some aspects of Mottola’s work that needed improvement. For instance, he wasn’t too keen on Daniel Craig’s portrayal of Bond. Nevertheless, his contributions were invaluable in terms of making Casino Royale a great poker movie.

#  Behind-the-Scenes of Poker Scenes in Casino Royale

Casino Royale is a 2006 spy film, the twenty-first in the Eon Productions James Bond series, and the third to star Daniel Craig as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond. Directed by Martin Campbell and written by Neal Purvis & Robert Wade and Paul Haggis, it is the first film to feature Craig in the role of Bond. The story concerns an attempt by the villain Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen) to finance terrorist attacks against NATO member countries through a high-stakes poker game, and Bond's subsequent efforts to stop him.

The film began principal photography on November 21, 2005 and concluded at Pinewood Studios on July 6, 2006. Casino Royale was released on November 17, 2006 to critical acclaim; praise focused on Craig's reinterpretation of the character, and the action scenes. It earned almost $600 million worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing James Bond film until Skyfall surpassed it in November 2012.

One of the most interesting aspects of Casino Royale are its behind-the-scenes stories. Let’s take a look at some of them.

1st off, prior to Casino Royale, Pierce Brosnan had played Bond in 4 films over a period of 12 years - GoldenEye (1995), Tomorrow Never Dies (1997), The World Is Not Enough (1999) and Die Another Day (2002). When it came time for Brosnan to reprise his role in Die Another Day - after having completed only 3 out 4 movies - he was reportedly asking for $14 million plus 2% of gross profits from Die Another Day. In a move that was likely orchestrated by MGM studio executives as Brosnan's contract neared its end and they were looking for ways to cut costs, they instead offered Craig $2 million plus 20% of gross profits to play 007 in Casino Royale. This meant that not only would Craig be getting paid 1/7th of what Brosnan was making at the end of his tenure as Bond, but Craig also had no guarantee he would get another movie should Casino Royale be successful. Obviously, Craig accepted MGM's offer and we all know how that turned out...

2nd story: One scene in Casino Royale features Daniel Craig emerging naked from a tank carrying Vesper Lynd (Eva Green). In order to make this scene realistic, a body double was used for Eva Green's breasts due to their nudity mandate from the MPAA ratings board. However, when it came time for Daniel Craig to appear nude in the same scene, he refused due to his family being present on set that day - choosing instead to use a body double for his posterior nudity shots. Again proving that he is one badass dude who puts family first...

3rd story: A huge chunk of Casino Royale was actually shot on Peter Jackson's Lord of The Rings stages at Wellington Film Studios in New Zealand. This allowed production designer Peter Lamont and his team plenty of space to create an amazing number of sets including Le Chiffre's study filled with computers and surveillance gear; an embassy ballroom; Miami airport turboprop hangar; Moldovan villa; Serbian castle; and an ultra-modern London MI6 building interior...

4th story: In order to accurately portray Agent 007 as someone who is new to being a field agent - unaccustomed both to violence and torture - screenwriter Paul Haggis did extensive research into how MI6 operates including spending time at SIS headquarters watching operatives working undercover...


So there you have it - some behind-the-scenes stories from Casino Royale that you may not have known about before! It just goes to show you that there is always more than meets the eye when it comes to making movies...
