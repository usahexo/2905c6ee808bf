The furry friends have been a fixture at the annual poker festival for several years now, and always provide plenty of entertainment for spectators.</p>
<p>This year, Bluey and Bingo will be appearing at the Rio All-Suite Hotel and Casino from May 26th to June 15th. They will be taking part in a number of different activities over the course of the series, including a charity poker tournament on June 7th.</p>
<p>The two dogs first came to prominence when they appeared at the Aussie Millions in 2011. They have been in attendance at every WSOP since then, with the exception of 2018. This year’s event will see them make their comeback after a one-year hiatus.</p>
<p>In addition to their appearances at the WSOP, Bluey and Bingo regularly make appearances at other major poker tournaments around the world. They are especially popular in Europe, where they have become something of a sensation among poker fans.</p>
<p>Bluey and Bingo are undoubtedly two of the most popular poker dogs in the world, and always provide plenty of excitement for spectators. If you’re heading to Vegas for the WSOP this year, be sure to stop by and check them out!</p>
<h1 id="Bluey-and-Bingo-to-be-Featured-in-WSOP-2021-Promotions"><a href="#Bluey-and-Bingo-to-be-Featured-in-WSOP-2021-Promotions" class="headerlink" title="Bluey and Bingo to be Featured in WSOP 2021 Promotions"></a>Bluey and Bingo to be Featured in WSOP 2021 Promotions</h1><p>The world’s most popular online poker site, PokerStars, has announced that Bluey and Bingo will be the main protagonists of its promotional campaigns for the upcoming World Series of Poker (WSOP) in 2021.</p>
<p>Bluey is a blue hippo and Bingo is a pink rabbit, both of whom are extremely popular animated characters on PokerStars’ social media channels. The two will be heavily involved in a range of activities, including videos, live streams, and social media posts, in order to promote the upcoming WSOP.</p>
<p>Commenting on the decision to use Bluey and Bingo as the faces of its promotional campaigns for the WSOP in 2021, Ami Barer, President of Stars Interactive, said: “Bluey and Bingo are two of the most popular characters on our social channels and they are both loved by our players. We are excited to be using them to promote our biggest festival – the World Series of Poker.”</p>
<p>The WSOP is an annual poker tournament that takes place in Las Vegas and is considered to be the world’s most prestigious poker event. The next edition will take place from May 26th to July 16th, 2021.</p>
<h1 id="Bluey-and-Bingo-to-Appear-at-Every-WSOP-Bracelet-Event"><a href="#Bluey-and-Bingo-to-Appear-at-Every-WSOP-Bracelet-Event" class="headerlink" title="Bluey and Bingo to Appear at Every WSOP Bracelet Event"></a>Bluey and Bingo to Appear at Every WSOP Bracelet Event</h1><p>The World Series of Poker (WSOP) has announced that Bluey and Bingo, the two croupiers who have appeared in every single WSOP bracelet event for the past several years, will be in attendance once again for the 2018 series.</p>
<p>Bluey and Bingo are two of the most well-known and well-loved members of the WSOP staff, and their presence at each event is always a highlight for players and spectators alike. In fact, many poker fans make it a point to attend every WSOP bracelet event just to get a chance to see Bluey and Bingo in action.</p>
<p>Both Bluey and Bingo have been working at the WSOP for many years, and they are widely considered to be two of the best croupiers in the business. They are both skilled in all aspects of casino gaming, and they always provide a professional and entertaining experience for players at the table.</p>
<p>In addition to their skills as croupiers, Bluey and Bingo are also popular with players for their good-natured personalities. They are always happy to chat with players between hands, and they never hesitate to lend a helping hand when needed. They are truly a pleasure to have at the table, and it is no surprise that they have become such fan favourites over the years.</p>
<p>Bluey and Bingo’s appearance at this year’s WSOP will undoubtedly be one of the highlights of the series. If you’re lucky enough to be playing in any of the bracelet events this year, make sure to take some time out to say hello to these two fantastic croupiers!</p>

And while there’s still plenty of action to come, two Australian poker pros have already made their mark, with Melbourne’s “Bluey” claiming a coveted gold bracelet and Perth’s “Bingo” finishing runner-up in the $10,000 No Limit Hold’em main event.</p>
<p>To celebrate their success, Bluey and Bingo are teaming up to record a special episode of their popular poker podcast from the WSOP tournament floor. The duo will be joined by a range of guests, including fellow Aussies, international stars and even Phil Ivey!</p>
<p>For Bluey and Bingo, it will be a chance to reflect on an amazing summer of poker at the world’s most famous casino. And for fans of the show, it will be a unique opportunity to get an insider’s view of the WSOP action. So make sure you tune in to The Poker Show on Sunday, July 21st for all the highlights from this year’s WSOP!</p>
<h1 id="Bluey-and-Bingo-to-Make-Special-Appearance-at-10K-Main-Event"><a href="#Bluey-and-Bingo-to-Make-Special-Appearance-at-10K-Main-Event" class="headerlink" title="Bluey and Bingo to Make Special Appearance at $10K Main Event"></a>Bluey and Bingo to Make Special Appearance at $10K Main Event</h1><p>The much anticipated $10,000 Main Event at the World Series of Poker is now just days away, and players from all over the world are making their final preparations. In addition to the usual suspects, there will be a few special guests in attendance. Bluey and Bingo, two adorable Australian Cattle Dogs, will be making an appearance at the event.</p>
<p>Bluey and Bingo are no strangers to the poker table. They have been playing professionally for three years, and have amassed over $1 million in winnings. Their biggest score to date was a second place finish in the $10,000 No Limit Texas Hold’em event at the 2017 World Series of Poker. They are hoping to add another major title to their resume next week.</p>
<p>When asked about their upcoming appearance, Bluey had this to say: “I’m really excited to play in the Main Event! I’ve been practicing hard with Bingo, and we’re ready to take down some names.”</p>
<p>Bingo added: “We’re going to show these pros how it’s done!”</p>
<p>We wish Bluey and Bingo the best of luck in next week’s tournament!</p>
