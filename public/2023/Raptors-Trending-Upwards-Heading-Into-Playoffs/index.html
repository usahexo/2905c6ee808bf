            </div>

        <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
      		<h1 id="Raptors-Trending-Upwards-Heading-Into-Playoffs"><a href="#Raptors-Trending-Upwards-Heading-Into-Playoffs" class="headerlink" title="Raptors Trending Upwards Heading Into Playoffs"></a>Raptors Trending Upwards Heading Into Playoffs</h1><p>The Toronto Raptors had a solid season, finishing with a record of 59-23 and the number one seed in the Eastern Conference. They were led by their All-Star duo of Kawhi Leonard and Pascal Siakam. Leonard averaged 26.6 points and 7.3 rebounds per game, while Siakam averaged 16.9 points and 6.9 rebounds per game. The Raptors have one of the best starting lineups in the NBA and are poised to make a deep playoff run.</p>
<p>One of the biggest reasons for the Raptors’ success this season is their improved defense. They ranked third in the league in defensive rating, allowing only 106.4 points per 100 possessions. Leonard has been a big part of this, as he is one of the best defenders in the NBA. He won his second Defensive Player of the Year award this season and is a major reason why the Raptors are so tough to beat defensively.</p>
<p>The Raptors also have plenty of depth on their roster. Players like Fred VanVleet, Serge Ibaka, and Danny Green provide valuable scoring off the bench. This will be important in the playoffs, as teams often go through stretches where their starters struggle offensively. The Raptors have enough firepower to compete with anyone in the East, and they should be considered one of the favorites to reach the NBA Finals.</p>
<h1 id="Betting-Against-the-Raptors-Could-Prove-Costly-This-Postseason"><a href="#Betting-Against-the-Raptors-Could-Prove-Costly-This-Postseason" class="headerlink" title="Betting Against the Raptors Could Prove Costly This Postseason"></a>Betting Against the Raptors Could Prove Costly This Postseason</h1><p>The Toronto Raptors will enter the Playoffs as the Number One seed in the Eastern Conference for the second consecutive year. As a result, they will be favored against most opponents in their quest to reach the NBA Finals. Betting against the Raptors could prove costly this postseason.</p>
<p>Toronto’s offense is anchored by their All-Star backcourt of Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan. The duo averaged a combined 50 points per game during the regular season. Lowry is one of the best point guards in the League, and he can score from anywhere on the court. DeRozan is a streaky shooter, but he is also an effective scorer in the post.</p>
<p>The Raptors’ frontcourt is also dangerous. Serge Ibaka and Jonas Valanciunas are both versatile big men who can shoot from outside, rebound, and block shots. They give Toronto a threat from both sides of the floor. Pascal Siakam provides energy off the bench, and he has emerged as a major contributor this season.</p>
<p>The Celtics may be the only team in the East with enough talent to beat Toronto in a seven-game series. Boston has an All-Star guard of their own in Kyrie Irving, and they also have a deep roster of talented players. The 76ers could be another possible threat to Toronto’s playoff run. Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid are two of the most exciting young players in the League, and they have led Philadelphia to one of the best records in the East this season.</p>
<p>Despite these threats, Toronto should be considered favorites to reach the NBA Finals. Their starting lineup is one of the most talented in basketball, and they have playoff experience from last season. Betting against them this postseason could prove costly for many bettors.</p>
<h1 id="Toronto-Poised-to-Make-a-Deep-Run-in-the-Playoffs"><a href="#Toronto-Poised-to-Make-a-Deep-Run-in-the-Playoffs" class="headerlink" title="Toronto Poised to Make a Deep Run in the Playoffs"></a>Toronto Poised to Make a Deep Run in the Playoffs</h1><p>The Toronto Raptors are coming off a disappointing season where they were bounced in the first round of the playoffs by the Washington Wizards. However, the Raptors made some key moves in the offseason that has them poised to make a deep run in the playoffs.</p>
<p>The biggest move the Raptors made was signing free agent swingman C.J. Miles. Miles is coming off his best season in which he averaged 14 points per game for the Indiana Pacers. He will provide Toronto with another scoring option and floor spacing, which should open up more driving lanes for Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan.</p>
<p>The Raptors also made a couple of low-key moves that could pay dividends down the road. They signed guard Norman Powell to a four-year, $42 million contract and forward Pascal Siakam to a three-year, $13 million contract. Powell impressed last season as a rookie, averaging 7.3 points per game, while Siakam showed flashes of potential during his rookie campaign this past year.</p>
<p>With all of these new additions, the Raptors are now one of the deepest teams in the Eastern Conference. And with Lowry and DeRozan leading the way, they are poised to make a deep run in the playoffs this year.</p>
<h1 id="Odds-Suggest-Raptors-Will-Not-Win-NBA-Finals-This-Year"><a href="#Odds-Suggest-Raptors-Will-Not-Win-NBA-Finals-This-Year" class="headerlink" title="Odds Suggest Raptors Will Not Win NBA Finals This Year"></a>Odds Suggest Raptors Will Not Win NBA Finals This Year</h1><p>The Toronto Raptors were one game away from the NBA Finals last year, but oddsmakers aren’t giving them much of a chance to win it all this year.</p>
<p>According to sports betting site Bovada, the Raptors have 18-1 odds of winning the title in 2019. That’s far behind the Golden State Warriors, who have 1-4 odds. The Los Angeles Lakers are second on the list with 6-1 odds, followed by the Boston Celtics at 7-1.</p>
<p>The Houston Rockets are also ahead of the Raptors with 12-1 odds, as are the Philadelphia 76ers at 14-1.</p>
<p>Toronto’s odds may have something to do with their offseason moves. The team lost Kawhi Leonard in free agency and traded Danny Green to the Lakers. They also signed Jeremy Lin, who is coming off a season where he played in just 36 games due to injury.</p>
<p>But head coach Nick Nurse isn’t deterred. “I like our chances,” he said at a press conference on Friday [August 9th]. “I like our guys. I like our team. I like our coaching staff…. We definitely have some work to do, but I think we’re up for that challenge…. We want to be considered amongst the elite teams and we want to win a championship and we’re going to do everything we can to put ourselves in that position.”</p>
<h1 id="Why-You-Should-Consider-Betting-on-the-Raptors-This-Playoff-Season"><a href="#Why-You-Should-Consider-Betting-on-the-Raptors-This-Playoff-Season" class="headerlink" title="Why You Should Consider Betting on the Raptors This Playoff Season"></a>Why You Should Consider Betting on the Raptors This Playoff Season</h1><p>The Toronto Raptors had an amazing regular season, finishing first in the Eastern Conference. This was a big step for the team, which has never been this successful in the playoffs before. If you’re looking for a reason to bet on the Raptors during this year’s playoff run, here are four reasons why you should consider it:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Raptors are Playing with Confidence</li>
</ol>
<p>The Raptors have been playing with confidence all season long, and that confidence has only grown as they’ve continued to win. They know they can beat any team in the East, and they’re not afraid of anyone. This is a dangerous team to face in the playoffs.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>The Raptors have Depth</li>
</ol>
<p>One of the things that makes the Raptors such a strong team is their depth. They have plenty of players who can step up and make big plays when needed. If one player is having a bad game, another player can step up and pick up the slack. This depth will serve them well during the playoffs.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>The Raptors are Well-Coached</li>
</ol>
<p>The Raptors are coached by Dwane Casey, who is considered one of the best coaches in the NBA. He knows how to get the most out of his players and how to win games. He’s been able to lead this team to success even when they’ve been facing adversity.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>The Raptors have Experience</li>
</ol>
<p>This is a very experienced team that knows what it takes to win in the playoffs. They’ve been tested before and they’ve come out victorious. They know how to execute under pressure and they won’t be intimidated by any opponent.</p>
